# Random Background Color Changer 🌈  

A simple web-based project that changes the background color of a webpage to a randomly generated color every second. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and timer-based interactivity.

---

## 📌 Features
- **Start Button**: Begins changing the background color every second.
- **Stop Button**: Stops the color-changing effect.
- **Random Color Generation**: Colors are generated in hexadecimal format (e.g., `#A1B2C3`).
- **Lightweight and Interactive**: Simple and responsive UI.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Basic styling.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for random color generation and interval handling.
